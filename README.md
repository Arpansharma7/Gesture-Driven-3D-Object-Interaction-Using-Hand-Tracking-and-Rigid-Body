# Gesture-Driven 3D Object Interaction Using Hand Tracking and Rigid Body
A project that combines Mediapipe's real-time pose detection with Blender's 3D animation tools. Create dynamic and interactive 3D physics simulation with ease.

tech stack -
*  pycharm for python main file
*  blender3d for 3d work

prerequisites -
*create a 3d environment inside blender3d and name the object which is about to be moved according to the scene.
*set the movable object as passive rigid body and all the interacting objects as active .

libraries used -
*  mediapipe
*  bpy
*  opencv
*  socket
*  math
